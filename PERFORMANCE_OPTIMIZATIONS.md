# Bar Joni Website Performance Optimizations

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to address the poor Lighthouse scores (26.5s LCP, 6.5s FCP) and improve the overall user experience.

## Key Issues Identified
1. **Large unoptimized images** - Main images were 170-240KB each
2. **Inefficient image loading** - No proper lazy loading or optimization
3. **Blocking Instagram embed** - Heavy third-party script blocking page load
4. **Suboptimal Astro configuration** - Missing performance optimizations
5. **No caching strategy** - Missing cache headers and service worker

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Astro Configuration Improvements (`astro.config.mjs`)
- **Fixed duplicate build configuration** - Removed conflicting settings
- **Added image optimization** - Enabled Sharp service for better image processing
- **Enhanced Vite build settings**:
  - Enabled Terser minification for smaller JavaScript bundles
  - Optimized asset naming with hashes for better caching
  - Disabled source maps for production
  - Set chunk size warnings
- **Improved prefetch strategy** - Changed from `prefetchAll: true` to `false` for better performance
- **Added dependency optimization** - Pre-bundled Lucide icons

### 2. Image Optimization Strategy
- **Created OptimizedPicture component** - Modern `<picture>` element with WebP support
- **Implemented proper lazy loading** - First 2 images load eagerly, rest lazy
- **Added responsive images** - Proper `sizes` attribute for different screen sizes
- **Set explicit dimensions** - Prevents layout shift with `aspect-ratio` CSS
- **Priority loading** - Critical images marked with `fetchpriority="high"`

### 3. Gallery Component Enhancements
- **Replaced Picture with OptimizedPicture** - Better performance and WebP support
- **Optimized Instagram embed loading**:
  - Added loading placeholder with spinner
  - Deferred Instagram script loading until user scrolls near
  - Implemented Intersection Observer with 200px margin
  - Added error handling and fallback link
- **Improved user experience** - Visual feedback during loading

### 4. Critical Resource Optimization
- **Enhanced preload strategy** in `index.astro`:
  - Hero image preloaded with high priority
  - Critical gallery images preloaded
  - DNS prefetch for external domains (Google Scripts, Instagram)
  - Resource hints for better loading
- **Optimized visitor tracking**:
  - Minimal data collection for better performance
  - Uses `requestIdleCallback` to avoid blocking main thread
  - Image pixel method for fastest tracking
  - Automatic cleanup after 5 seconds

### 5. Caching and Service Worker
- **Added .htaccess file** for GitHub Pages:
  - Compression for text files
  - Cache headers for static assets (30 days for images/CSS/JS)
  - Security headers
- **Implemented Service Worker** (`public/sw.js`):
  - Caches critical resources immediately
  - Network-first strategy with cache fallback
  - Automatic cache cleanup
  - Offline support for HTML pages

### 6. Build Optimizations
- **Added Terser dependency** - Enables JavaScript minification
- **Optimized asset bundling** - Better chunk splitting and naming
- **Reduced bundle sizes**:
  - CSS: 39KB (optimized and minified)
  - Main JS: 2.1KB (compressed)
  - Total page size significantly reduced

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- **First Contentful Paint**: 6.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: 26.5s
- **Total Blocking Time**: 0ms
- **Speed Index**: 6.6s

### Expected After Optimizations:
- **First Contentful Paint**: ~1-2s (70% improvement)
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: ~2-4s (85% improvement)
- **Total Blocking Time**: <100ms
- **Speed Index**: ~2-3s (60% improvement)

## Key Benefits
1. **Faster initial page load** - Critical resources prioritized and optimized
2. **Better perceived performance** - Loading states and progressive enhancement
3. **Reduced bandwidth usage** - WebP images and compression
4. **Improved caching** - Service worker and proper cache headers
5. **Better mobile experience** - Responsive images and optimized loading
6. **Offline capability** - Service worker provides basic offline functionality

## Monitoring and Testing
- Test performance with Lighthouse after deployment
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
- Check service worker registration in browser dev tools
- Verify image optimization and WebP delivery

## Next Steps
1. Deploy changes to GitHub Pages
2. Run new Lighthouse audit
3. Monitor real user metrics
4. Consider additional optimizations based on results:
   - Image compression further if needed
   - Critical CSS inlining
   - Font optimization
   - Additional lazy loading for below-fold content

## Files Modified
- `astro.config.mjs` - Build and performance configuration
- `src/components/OptimizedPicture.astro` - New optimized image component
- `src/components/Gallery.astro` - Enhanced with optimized loading
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Critical resource optimization
- `public/.htaccess` - Caching and compression headers
- `public/sw.js` - Service worker for caching
- `package.json` - Added Terser dependency

These optimizations should significantly improve the website's performance scores and provide a much better user experience, especially on slower connections and mobile devices.
